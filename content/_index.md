# Welcome to the Panaderia

The Panaderia (Spanish for bakery) is a testbed comprised of 8 raspberry Pis, two switches and a router. The goal of this test bed is to evaluate different congestion control protocols by providing a controlled and realistic networking environment. 

Specifically, we aim to evaluate new alternative methods for congestion control algorithms such as [BBR](https://github.com/google/bbr)
