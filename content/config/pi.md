For our servers and clients, we used 8 raspberry pi 3B+ running a modified Raspbian image. Each of these can be purchased for under $50. As they run Linux, they are able to run all of the different congestion control algorithms (specially, we are interested in BBR). 

We provide information on the steps we took to recompile the Kernel, as well as performance measurements for the Pis.
